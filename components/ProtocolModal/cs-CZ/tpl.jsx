              The platform interrupts or terminates the service to the member due to the
              member&#39;s violation of laws and regulations or the provisions of this agreement,
              the member&#39;s behavior before the service interruption or termination shall be
              handled according to the following principles:

              The platform reserves the right to delete the relevant information of the goods
              uploaded to the platform system by the member before the service interruption or
              termination;
              <br />
              Before service interruption or termination, if a member informs the platform that it
              has entered into a contract with another member for a specific transaction, the
              platform may not delete such information, but the platform has the right to inform the
              trading party of the member of the interruption or termination of the service at the
              same time.
